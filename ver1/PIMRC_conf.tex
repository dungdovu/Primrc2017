\section{Introduction}
\label{section1}
% no \IEEEPARstart
A smart city is an urban development vision to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) and Internet of things (IoT) technology which is the way of becoming the next technological revolution \cite{Delicato2013} securely to manage a city's assets. IoT is a framework in which all things have a representation and a presence on the Internet. More specifically, the IoT aims at offering new applications and services bridging the physical and virtual worlds, in which Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication represents the baseline interface that enables the interactions between things and applications on the cloud such as environment monitoring \cite{Lazarescu2013}\cite{Kelly2013}, object tracking \cite{Gama2012}, traffic management \cite{Foschini2011}, health care \cite{Jara2011}, and smart home technology \cite{Tozlu2012}\cite{Li2011}. Organizations can use IoT to drive considerable cost savings by improving asset utilization, enhancing process efficiency and boosting productivity. IoT combines the exponential growth of smart devices,  the confluence of low-cost technologies (sensors, wireless networks, big data, and computing power), the pervasive connectivity, and the massive volumes of big data. Hence, IoT and big data are two sides of the same coin. An IoT device generates continuous streaming information in a scalable way. Companies must handle the high volume of stream data and perform actions on that one. These actions can be event correlation, matrix calculation, statistic preparation and analytic which are applied to construct the smart city. In the smart city, the waste management system is a crucial point of living environment, and its quality is considered seriously. A possible smart waste city management system requires a way to cluster the trash bin locations, detect the status of waste in each bin, and process this collected data. The result of this work will be a valuable input data for the garbage truck management system which calculates the most optimal route to prevent the hazard of damage, pollution of waste, and resource consumptions. 

\par To manage the waste of a smart city, the system incorporates a model for sharing data between truck drivers in the real time to perform garbage collection and the route optimization was proposed in \cite{Medvedev2015}. A waste collection solution based on providing intelligence of trash cans including sensors and IoT prototype, which can read, collect, and transmit trash volume data via wireless network was proposed in \cite{Gutierreza2015}\cite{Hong2014}. An adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm of finding optimal cost routes of garbage trucks was presented in \cite{Buhrkala212}, which processes the data of all emptied trash bins and the driven waste to disposal sites while respecting customer time windows. An improved dynamic route planning was discussed in \cite{Nuorito2006} where the authors enhanced a guided variable neighborhood threshold meta-heuristic adapted to the problem of waste collection. On the other hand, the most important part of a waste management system was the smart bin \cite{Sharma2015}\cite{Glouche2013}\cite{Sinhan2013} which collected the data of waste by using sensors and sent them over the internet to the server for monitoring the status of waste. While the network of ultrasonic sensors enabled smart bins to connect through the cellular network and generated a large amount of data which was further analyzed and visualized at real time to gain insights about the status of waste around the city \cite{Sharma2015}, a smart waste management with self-describing objects detected the kind of waste based on its Radio-frequency identification (RFID) information \cite{Glouche2013}. However, they did not know the hazard of each bin such as explosion or flame from the bottle of perfume, batteries, and electronic wastes. In \cite{Sinhan2013}, a hazard detection method was proposed to detect and prevent these issues. Hence, a waste city management was conducted by an optimal garbage truck routes algorithm based on the status of the smart bin. 

However, we observed that citizens in the city tend to throw their waste into the trash bins without a particular time of a day and the manager needs to add more bins during the holiday event time. As previous works do not solve this issue, the novelty of our work proposes a new method to automatically classify the location of trash bins, predict the status of each one, and optimize the garbage truck routes. The aim of this proposition is to help the cityâ€™s waste management system to operate more efficiently. 

\par\textbf{Contributions:} 
This paper presents a new method of smart waste city management which provides a clean and hygienic environment to the city resident. In this approach, the collected data from the trash bin has been transferred over the Internet to the server which contains the status of each bin. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The number of working clusters in each city are optimized and the location of new trash bins are classified automatically. 
	
	\item A regression algorithm is applied to predict the situation of waste which can reduce the overload trash bin phenomenon while the garbage truck is coming.
	
	\item The priority weight of each bin is considered to improve the optimal garbage truck routes algorithm more efficiently.
	
\end{itemize}

Finally, to the best of authorsâ€™ knowledge, no result exists before our contribution. 

This paper is organized as the follows: In section \ref{section2},  a new method of smart waste city management (SWCM) is explained and the structure of the algorithm is proposed. Section \ref{section3} presents the SWCM simulation model. Finally, the related concluding remarks are discussed in section \ref{section4}.



\section{IoT-Based Smart waste management model}
\label{section2}
In this section, we describe how to collect waste metadata associated with their statuses and locations. We evaluate our model with real big data in order to validate its output result.
\subsection{Data acquisition} 


\par To obtain a set of waste data, we use an open source database,\footnote{https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset} which has a significant amount of geo-location information and status of trash bins at the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the United Stated named Philadelphia. Figure \ref{Philadelphia} illustrates the distribution of trash bin (green node) in Philadelphia city. Since there are many contents in this data, we removed the content that was not related to our scenario. For data analysis, five essential fields from this metadata are presented in the Table \ref{t1}.

	\textit{lon} &  The longitude of each trash bin\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}




\subsection{System description}
\label{systemdesciption}
\subsubsection{The overview of functionality}


The proposed system is based on the waste status of each trash bin in the city. The collected data is sent over the Internet to the server where it is stored and processed. At here, it is used for monitoring and predicting the status of each trash bin daily. Moreover, it will be utilized for calculating the optimal garbage truck routes, accordingly. The prediction status of each bin can be analyzed based on the given training data before it occurs. Then, it will be considered to update the weight of the trash bin accordingly which is the most important input parameter of optimal garbage truck routes algorithm. The system overview is shown in the Figure \ref{fig2}.


\subsubsection{Data processing and classifications}


The status of each bin is not homogeneous and significantly differs from each other according to the state of each location. In this section, we introduce an algorithm that can be used to dynamically and efficiently manage waste collection strategies.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{Model1-2}

\end{figure}

\par K-means \cite{Kanungo2003} is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups a dataset into a user-specified number ($k$) of clusters. We use it to make the working cluster of each garbage truck. However, this algorithm is somewhat naive, it clusters the data into $k$ clusters, even if $k$ is not the right number of clusters to use. Therefore, when using k-means clustering, users need some way to determine whether they are using the right number of clusters. In this paper, we use Elbow method \cite{Kodinariya2013} \cite{Maria2001} to validate the number of clusters. The collecting routes are the traveling cycles containing a set of trash bins within a given cluster. The optimization of these cycles is a combinatorial optimization problem. By considering a large number of routes, we use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) \cite{Gutierrez2008} which are relatively fast in providing near optimal solutions. Since the garbage truck needs time to collect every trash bin, it is very delightful if a status of trash bin can be predicted. Hence, after predicting, the system will recommend which one should be collected to prevent the overload phenomenon. In this paper, we use the Logistic regression algorithm \footnote{https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/courses/ling289/logistic.pdf} to predict the status of each trash bin based on its historical data.


\par  The overall procedure is summarized in Algorithm \ref{algorithm1}. In this algorithm, the parameters are defined in Table \ref{table1}. We suppose that the input dataset $\mathcal{D}$ is the database in Section \ref{section2}. At the given time stamp $t$, a logistic regression (LR) algorithm is applied to predict the status of each bin. If the prediction status $s_{jh}$ of bin is greater than the given threshold $\eta$, the weight $w_{jh}$ is updated to $1$, respectively, then the GA algorithm is utilized to minimize the driving distance for visiting the selected bins and returning to the headquarters. Therefore, we find the optimal garbage truck routes in each cluster $M_j$ which help us to prevent the collect trash bin more efficiently.

In this section, using the proposed Algorithm \ref{algorithm1} in Section \ref{systemdesciption}, we first analyze the number of working cluster and then show the experimental result. We simply assume $\eta = 0.5$, which can also to be set another value to monitor the amount of waste. 

\subsection{Number of working cluster}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=6cm]{elbow6}
	\caption{The optimal value of number working clusters}
	\label{fig3}
\end{figure}



One  method of validating the number clusters for K-means algorithm is the Elbow method. It looks at the percentage of variance explained as a function of the number of clusters: One should choose a number of clusters so that adding another cluster does not give much better modeling of the data. In the general, $k \in [1;\infty]$ but for the simple experiment, we choose $k\in[1;15]$ in our work. To estimate the optimal value of $k^*$, we use the function Elbow($\mathcal{D}\rightarrow$L, $n$) which considers the value within-cluster variance $W(DC_j)$ of a cluster $DC_j$ which is defined as $\sum_{l_i\in DC_j}\norm{l_i-\bar{l_j}}^2$, where $\bar{l_j}$ is the mean of cluster $DC_j$ (also called the cluster centroid, its values are the coordinate-wise average fo the data points in $DC_j$), and $\{l_1, l_2,..., l_n\}$ is the set of trash bin location. The total within cluster scatter is $W = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{l_i\in DC_j}\norm{l_i-\bar{l_j}}^2$ for $k$ clusters and $n$ observations. A good choice value of $k^*$ is considered if this value tends to change slowly and remain less changing as compared to other $k$'s.\footnote{https://www.r-bloggers.com/finding-optimal-number-of-clusters/} We see a pretty clear Elbow at $k^* = 5$ in Figure \ref{fig3} and table \ref{tab3}, which indicates that $5$ is the best number of clusters.




\par Using the value of $k^*$ above, we apply the K-means algorithm to make the working clusers for our system. The output is represented in the Figure \ref{fig4}. If the manager tend to add more trash bins into our system, the system will automatically update these working clusters.

\subsection{Prediction the status of trash bin} 

In fact, when the garbage trucks are running on the road, the status of trash bins can be modified. It is very delightful to predict the status of trash bin, then update the weight of this one. After that, the system will update the optimal garbage truck route. A Logistic regression algorithm is applied to work on this issue. 

We pick up randomly one trash bin in one cluster whose serial number and location are $171758$ and ($39.95204^o,-75.15911^o$), respectively to analyze the output result for convenience. Fistly, We convert all the date to the numeric data type\footnote{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/lubridate.pdf} which is utilized for the Logistic regression algorithm. Figure \ref{fig5a} represents the relation between weight (green circle) and the time stamp of this trash bin. In this figure, the red line represents the trend of trash bin's weight. By considering a given time, if the red line approaches the value $1$, the weight of trash bin will be updated to $1$, respectively. Hence, the optimal garbage truck route will be constructed based on the new weight.

	\label{fig5}
	
\end{figure}

In the each cluster dataset $\mathcal{DC}_j$, where $j \in [1:k]$, we observed that the original system has three status levels of bin such as RED, YELLOW, and GREEN. Let we assume that when $\eta = 0.5$ the trash bin's level is RED or YELLOW and its weight is $1$, otherwise it is $0$.

\par Since we need to update the optimal garbage truck routes daily for collecting the high weight trash bin, so we would like to pick up a milestone randomly which is ``2014-06-16" in our dataset to make the simulation. By using the GA algorithm, the optimal garbage truck routes of each working cluster are constructed based on the weight and coordinate of trash bins. In the Figure \ref{fig5}, the red point is the high weight trash bin and the arrow is the route of garbage truck. It means that the garbage trucks collected all the trash bin whose weigh is $1$ by using the optimal routes. Hence, the system will help the smart city to reduce the traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and pollution.






\section{Conclusion and future works}
\label{section4}

In this paper, we first clustered the working area by using the open source database of Philadelphia. Especially, we introduced an algorithm which automatically makes the working clusters and calculates the optimal garbage truck routes. Also, we use the Logistic regression to predict and update the weight of each trash bin. They will be used for creating the new optimal garbage route which reduces the pollution and fuel consumption more efficiently.  

To further improve the algorithm, future work, the optimal garbage truck routes within each cluster need to be fitted with the street map data.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
